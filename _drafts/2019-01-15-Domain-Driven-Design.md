DDD is useful for solving complex problems 

It encourages interaction with Domain Experts 

Encourage to deal single sub domain at a time by divide and conquer. by focus and isolating each small component at at time we can improve efficiency and testability to the development process. 

DDD is a great way to apply the Separation of concerns principle in the domain level,but also within the sub domain level.
