If you are a web developer, you will either work around the quirk or not use it all. Thankfully those days are over with the ever increasing competition and rapid improvement in software delivering process. Updates to software are expected in days, not in months or years. With increasing expectation of faster bug fixes and feature update comes at a cost; Updates in a large monolithic system can be painful in many ways. A bug in small update in a large system could bring the whole system down if not managed properly. This makes rapid updates to a large complex system rather risky and fragile. To over come this issue, a new type of software architecture has emerged in the past decade with the primary focus of resolve this problem.

    <p>Remember the old days when Microsoft “ships” out a new IE every few years and if you found an annoying quirk in the browser? tough luck, you would have to waiting for a fair while for the changes to come through. If you are a web developer, you will either work around the quirk or not use it all.  Thankfully those days are over with the ever increasing competition and rapid improvement in software delivering process. Updates to software are expected in days, not in months or years. 
With increasing expectation of faster bug fixes and feature update comes at a cost; Updates in a large monolithic system can be painful in many ways. A bug in small update in a large system could bring the whole system down if not managed properly. This makes rapid updates to a large complex system rather risky and fragile. To over come this issue, a new type of software architecture has emerged in the past decade with the primary focus of resolve this problem. By separating a large system into a number of small loosely coupled independent components that communicated using a common protocol, it makes the system more resilient to minor issues and less risky when it comes to updates. This style of software design is Microservices architecture.</p>

<h3 id="microservices-generally-to-have-the-following-characteristics">Microservices generally to have the following characteristics:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It should be independent and easily testable in isolation.</li>
  <li>It should be loosely coupled to other components.</li>
  <li>horizontally scalable.</li>
  <li>It’s operation does not depend on the other microservices, meaning that if a related services goes down, the microservice does not go down with it.</li>
  <li>Each microservice should have clear definition of scope and responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Communicate over a common, stateless protocol (e.g. HTTP)</li>
  <li>Microservices in a large system can use different programing language, framework or infrastructure as long as it conform to the communication structure using a standard protocol(Typically RESTful HTTP API)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="net-core-as-a-microservices">.NET Core as a microservices:</h3>

<p>Microservices can be written in different programing languages and frameworks running on various type of infrastructures, It can be written in Java, NodeJs, Python or the Traditional .Net Framework. .Net Core is just one of many option out of many that can used.<br />
If you are experienced in the .NET space, .NET Core is a better option compared to the Traditional .NET framework because it has been designed ground up by Microsoft to be highly portable and flexible. It can be ran on major operation systems such as Linux, Mac and the default Windows servers.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-dockerised-web-api">Create a Dockerised Web API:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new project in VS2017 goto <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project &gt; ASP.NET Core Web Application</strong></li>
  <li>Enter the <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Location</strong> and <strong>Solution Name</strong>. I named it <strong>DockerWebAPI</strong></li>
  <li>Choose <strong>.NET Core</strong>, <strong>ASP.NET Core 2.1</strong>, Choose <strong>API</strong> and Tick <strong>Enable Docker Support</strong>  Click <strong>Ok</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/docker-web-api.PNG" alt=".NET docker web API " /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Once the project has been created, you will see the <strong>DockerWebApi &gt; Dockerfile</strong> docker file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Open your <strong>Dockerfile</strong> and replace the content with the following:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  FROM microsoft/dotnet:sdk AS build-env
  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
  COPY *.csproj ./

  # use NuGet to restore dependencies and project-specific tools that 
  # are specified in the project file. Can be excluded in .net 2.0
  RUN dotnet restore 

  # Copy everything else and build
  COPY . ./
  RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out  #folder is out

  # Build runtime image
  FROM microsoft/dotnet:aspnetcore-runtime
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY --from=build-env /app/out .
  ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "WebApplicationDocker.dll"]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>If you are using Mac or Windows 10, you change run the application natively in Docker mode
  <img src="/assets/docker-web-api-run.PNG" alt=".NET docker web API Run" /></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using Windows 8 like me, you will need to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/">Docker Toolbox</a>. Once installed you can use the Docker CLI tool called <strong>Docker Quickstart Terminal</strong><br />
<img src="/assets/docker-terminal.PNG" alt=".NET docker terminal" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the Docker terminal, change directory the root of your project, enter <code class="highlighter-rouge">Docker build -t dockerwebapi:latest .</code>.
If your build is successful you should see **successfully built <imageid> **</imageid></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To check if your build image has been created, enter: <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker images</code>
You should see <strong>dockerwebapi</strong> on the top of the list of repositories returned by the command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To test the build, You can run
<code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name mydockerwebapi dockerwebapi</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are running native docker on your machine, <a href="http://localhost:8080/api/values">http://localhost:8080/api/values</a><br />
If you are using Docker tools, goto <a href="http://192.168.99.100:8080/api/values">http://192.168.99.100:8080/api/values</a>
You should the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[
"value1",
"value2"
]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Congrats! you have created your first Dotnet Core Webapi microservices on Docker!</p>
